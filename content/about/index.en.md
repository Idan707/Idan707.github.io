I could give you the buzzword-packed corporate spiel, but here’s the deal: 

I build stuff that works—whether it’s cutting-edge AI for business or things like:
- Postperfect.me - Chrome extension for LinkedIn 
- Transcriptionfree.com - Captions for your shorts videos 
- word-sweeper.vercel.app - free mini game (built with Arbel Israeli / search wordweeper in app stores)

I’ve spent 10+ years in the data and AI world, from catching financial criminals with unsupervised learning to wrangling LLMs and AI agents.

At OpenWeb, I built the AI/ML team from scratch, infrastructure and core IP for real-time moderation at huge scale. Before that, I helped turned ideas into multi-million dollar products at ThetaRay. 

Oh, and did I mention I’m obsessed with shipping solutions fast and making an impact?
