There's a new fancy coffee shop that just opened across the street. The coffee shop offers the option to pre-order your coffee and just come 'n' grab it (that's their branding). It employs the fastest baristas, so even if you missed out on pre-ordering, they will serve you at lightspeed. A few months went by, and the coffee shop owners noticed huge delays in coffee ordering and pick-ups, which led to decreased customers. But why? Turns out the entryway had a long corridor that was too narrow for two people to go through. More than that, the same entryway also functioned as the only exit as well. You wouldn't want your code  to perfome poorly just because of a the door way, right?

## 1 Understanding Bottlenecks

Imagine a busy highway during rush hour – that one slow-moving section that brings all the traffic to a crawl. Such problem, and the problem described in the intro can come in many forms, and they're often referred to as rate-limiting steps or *bottlenecks*. **Before actually solving the bottleneck, it's first important to know how to identify them.**

As a data scientist, identifying those weak spots that limit my models' inference time is crucial, especially when the model is served in real-time and every millisecond counts. The importance of inference time increases even more when the problem at hand involves end-users. For instance, let's say you developed a model to predict which of the thousand ad sources will provide you with the highest margin (make you the most money) when displayed on your website. You can't afford to take infinite time for the prediction and have the user wait for the ad to load.

So whether you're into data science (like me) or casual Python coding, smoother code means happier users and a more joyful programming journey for you!

## 2 Profiling Tools
- Introduce various profiling tools available in Python (e.g., cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler).
- Briefly explain how each tool can help identify bottlenecks.

## 3 Time Complexity Analysis
- Explain the concept of time complexity and its importance in identifying bottlenecks.
- Provide examples of common time complexity classes (e.g., O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), etc.).
- Show how to analyze code for time complexity using Big O notation.

## 4 Memory Usage Analysis
- Discuss the significance of memory optimization in addition to time optimization.
- Explain memory profiling and how it can help identify memory bottlenecks.
- Offer examples of memory-efficient practices.

## 5 Real-World Examples from Data Science
- Provide scenarios where bottlenecks commonly occur in data science tasks (e.g., data loading, preprocessing, model training, inference).
- Illustrate how to identify bottlenecks in these scenarios using profiling tools and analysis techniques.

## 6 Strategies for Bottleneck Identification
- Present a step-by-step process for identifying bottlenecks:
    1. Profile your code using relevant tools.
    2. Analyze time complexity and memory usage patterns.
    3. Focus on code sections with higher time complexity or excessive memory usage.
- Emphasize the importance of starting with the most time/memory-consuming parts.

## 7 Mitigation Techniques
- Offer strategies for optimizing code once bottlenecks are identified:
    - Algorithmic improvements: Choose more efficient algorithms or data structures.
    - Parallelization: Utilize multi-threading or multi-processing for CPU-bound tasks.
    - Vectorization: Leverage vectorized operations for numeric computations.
    - Caching: Store and reuse intermediate results where applicable.

## 8 Testing and Benchmarking
- Discuss the role of testing and benchmarking in verifying the effectiveness of bottleneck mitigation.
- Explain how to measure performance before and after optimization.
- Suggest using tools like **`timeit`** for simple benchmarks.

## 9 General Application Across Professions
- Reiterate that the principles of bottleneck identification and optimization are not limited to data science and can benefit various fields.
- Provide examples from other domains (e.g., web development, system administration) to demonstrate versatility.

## 10 Conclusion

- Summarize the key takeaways: the importance of identifying bottlenecks, the tools and techniques available, and the significance of optimization across professions.
- Encourage readers to apply these practices to their own projects and explore further.
